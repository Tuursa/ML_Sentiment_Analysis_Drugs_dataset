# ML_Sentiment_Analysis_Drugs_dataset

## INTRODUCTION
The freestyle format of hackathons has time and again stimulated groundbreaking and innovative data insights and technologies. 
This project is based on the dataset uploaded at The Kaggle University Club Hackathon - UCI Machine Learning - Drug Review Dataset.

### Prompt

Machine learning has permeated nearly all fields and disciplines of study. One hot topic is using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify, extract, and make use of subjective information. The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. This data was published in a study on sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, ex. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects (see the acknowledgments section to learn more).

### About the datasets
The Drug Review Data Set is of shape (161297, 7) i.e. It has 7 features including the review and 161297 Data Points or entries.

The features are 'drugName' which is the name of the drug, 'condition' which is the condition the patient is suffering from, 'review' is the patients review, 'rating' is the 10-star patient rating for the drug, 'date' is the date of the entry and the 'usefulcount' is the number of users who found the review useful.

### About the project
With this dataset, I have tried to answer the following questions/conditions:
* What insights can we gain from exploring and visualizing our data?

* How does sentiment play into rating and usefulness of reviews?

* Can we create a way for people to find the best medication for their illness?

* What machine learning models work best for predicting the sentiment or rating based on review?
